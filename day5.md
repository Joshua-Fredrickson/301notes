day2

MVC ->  model:      data
        view:       presentation
        controller: behavior

the DOM is an API (an interface )
the DOM is a representation of your HTML (it's an editable layer -jf)

intro to jQuery
    Selection (say "I query the DOM"), 
    manipulation (say "I manipulated the DOM"), 
    and traversal of the DOM.

$('el') this is a function that enters a parameter.  the parameters are css selectors.  
(fyi .find is very performant)

Remember jQuery is objects build the stuff into the console.
