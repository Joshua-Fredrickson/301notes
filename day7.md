### node.js
node is not a browser based tool.
event-driven i.e. event emitter module
non-blocking I/O model -> we can interact with a data and deconstruct it down to binerary. 
    -> this is also asynchronous model.
*it's single threaded model (that has a call back que)
It's great for our API development and command line I/O.

node is built into the terminal!!!!
>this = the global object on the computer!

*** caveats with ES6 


### npm - node packet manager
check out npm website to find out about packages (and then it checkout on GitHub)
the packages are like a library

NODE.JS project:
create an empty director:
type npm that gives you the manual page


npm init -> it walks you through a prompt that creates a package.json file that is at the root of all web app.

npm init -y creates a blank package.json file.

### express.js
