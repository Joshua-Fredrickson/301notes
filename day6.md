# Day 6 - AJAX, JSON, HTTP AND WRRC

## JSON Reveiw
-CodeFellows has chosen to JSON with compared to xml.
JavaScript Object Notation (this is a stringified object)  -  this is a DATA Model
Serialization = is "dehydration for data structures".  this is how we interchange between client and server.

AJAX allows you to grab the data asynchronously.  (there are different methods to handle the JSON with jQuery and AJAX).

send a request:

1. specify the request "method", URL, settings
    Methods

    $.ajax, $.load, $.get, $.getJSON, $.post
